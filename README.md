This repository is the curated roadmap that a beginner needs to became ML Expert.

## What is this all about?
This repository is the single source of information that a beginner need in order to shape and hone his/her skills in the field of Machine Learning and AI. There are plenty of resources out there
and therefore this creates a mess and for the beginner, it is hard to keep him/her on track without losing his/her momentum.

I have created this repository to solve the problem that a beginner get's in. This guide is in beta stage and we are 
currently researching and updating this guide to make sure it can fulfil some of the problems we find when a student starts:
1. Not all students have money and if they have most of them don't have cards to pay.
2. Should I start with python or R?
3. Should I start deep learning or machine learning?
4. Do I need to know mathematics before I start?
5. Where can I get the latest information about ML and to whom should I follow on social media to stay up to date?

## Where should I began?
**_I am a learner where should I start my journey in ML?_**
